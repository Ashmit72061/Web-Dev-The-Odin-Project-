    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the frog legs and soak them in milk. Keep the bowl in the refrigerator
            for at least an hour. Meanwhile, take another bowl and add salt, black pepper and flour in it. Mix properly.
            Chop the garlic and parsley.</li>
        <li>Now, take a large frying pan and melt 5 tablespoons of the butter in it. Keep
            in mind that the pan should be large enough to accommodate all the frog legs at once. If you don’t have a
            pan as large, place a baking sheet in the oven and, keep a rack inside. You can store half the fried frog
            legs here while you fry the rest.</li>
        <li>Set the oven to 180°F. And if you have a large pan, place the baking sheet
            with the rack set inside next to the stovetop.</li>
        <li>Now, take the frog legs and evenly coat them with seasoned flour. Get rid of
            the excess flour. Transfer the frog legs to the pan with melted butter and fry on medium-high heat. Make
            sure to let it cook until it turns golden in color. This should take you about 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Remember that the flour coating is very delicate. So, if you can help it, try
            to flip it once.</li>
        <li>Once the legs are done, place them on the rack to drain the excess oil. </li>
        <li>Now remove the butter in the pan, and using a paper towel, properly clean it.
            Place it on the stove again and add butter. Heat over medium-high flame. </li>
        <li>Once the butter gets hot, add the garlic and sauté for about 1 minute. Turn
            off the flame and add in the lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Combine the parsley with the prepared sauce. Assemble the frog legs on
            individual plates and pour the parsley-sauce mixture over it and there you have it! Your frog legs are ready
            to be eaten!</li>
    </ol>
